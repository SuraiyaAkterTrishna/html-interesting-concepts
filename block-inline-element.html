    <!-- Conceptual
        What is the difference between inline and block elements?
        - HTML elements historically were categorized as either "block-level" elements or "inline-level" elements. 

        An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Ex - <a>, <img>, <br>, <span>, <abbr> etc. 

        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. Ex - <div>, <p>, <h1> - <h6>, <ul>, <li>, <ol> -->
</body>
