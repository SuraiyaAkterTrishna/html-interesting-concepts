    <!-- The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the
    content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing
    the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS
    box model. Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below:

    content: This property is used to displays the text, images, etc, that can be sized using the width & height property.
